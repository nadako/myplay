Things to be done:

 * implement track reordering and inserting uri in custom position
 * improve GUI:
  - playlist row activation should automatically play uri,
    not only set it as current
  - support simple command-line parameters
  - save window size and position
 * add command-line interface
 * handle errors: bad uri's, broken streams, etc.
 * improve setup: add .service and .desktop files, add
   file accociations
 * add license headers and README files
