MyPlay is a very simple music player. It follows two main principles that
make it kinda different:

 * It works directly with files, without creating a "music library", so it's
   your freedom and duty to organize your collection as you want with ordinary
   folders.
 
 * It works as a background service, playing its playlist without creating any
   windows or notification icons. However a number of UIs can be provided to
   control it. This package provides simple GTK+-based graphical interface.

The player is implemented as a D-BUS service utilizing GStreamer framework to do
actual playing. It provides a D-BUS interface to modify playlist and control playing.

Also, because of usage of GStreamer, this player supports network streams as well.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The D-BUS API considered not stable and can be changed before version 1.0.
