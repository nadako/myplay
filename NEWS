Changes
=======

0.2.0 (unreleased)
------------------

 * Use "audio-volume-high" icon for window and launcher for now.
 * Add simple tags support.
    - Changed the signature of list method: now it returns array
      of (uri, tag_dict) tuples.
    - Added the tag_changed(uri, tag_dict) signal. It is fired when
      player receives new tag information about some uri.
    - The added(tracks, position) signal now had different first parameter
      type: instead of array of uris, it's now an array of (uri, tag_dict)
      tuples, like in the "list" method.
    - Display tags in GUI.
 * The "add" method doesn't support -1 position anymore, use playlist length
   instead (so it added before inexistant after-last element, just like
   in python lists).
 * Rename DBus exception names. Note, that the API is considered unstable before
   version 1.0, so I can do whatever I want, hahaha :-)
 * Add playlist row tooltip showing path to a file.
 * Support removing tracks from playlist using Delete key.
 * Fix a bug with wrong "current track" after reordering.
 * Misc code and GUI fixes.
